This portfolio website showcases the work of a student web developer. The website includes a variety of projects that the student has worked on, from simple personal websites to more complex web applications. The projects are all well-designed and functional, and they demonstrate the student's skills in web development.

The website is also well-organized and easy to navigate. The projects are grouped by category. The website also includes a contact form, so visitors can get in touch with the student if they have any questions or would like to hire them for a project.
